AI Challenger is a platform for open datasets and programming competitions to artificial intelligence (AI) talents around the world. To participate, please visit https://challenger.ai/.

## Evaluation ##

Evaluation scripts for AI Challenger competitions are included. Scripts for each competition track are provided in separate folders, respectively.

## Baselines ##

We also provide baseline model for some of the competition tracks. Please keep in mind that these are just baselines, and they are only meant to help you get started. You should expect only modest result unless serious improvement is made to the models.
